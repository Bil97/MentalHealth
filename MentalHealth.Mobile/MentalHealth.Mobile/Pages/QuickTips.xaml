<div>Anxiety problems can develop in a couple of different ways:
    genetics and life experiences.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h4>Genetics</h4>
    <p>Anxiety problems can be passed on genetically. If someone is your immediate or extended family, like your mom, dad, grandma or uncle has had problems withanxiety, then you might be more likely to develop an anxiety problem.</p>
    <h4 class="card-title">Life Experiences</h4>
    <p>Certain life events or experiences can make us more likely to develop problems with anxiety.</p>
    <p>
        <b>For example, getting teased or bullied when you're younger</b> can make you more uncomfortable talking to new people when you're older.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Having a bad experience at the dentist</b> can make you more likely to fear going to the dentist in the future
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Things at home may not be so great.</b> Mom and dad might be fighting a lot. They might be very critical of yo or put a lot of of pressure on you to do well at school.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Sometimes we may witness things that make us anxious.</b> For example, eeing someone almost drown might make you super scared of water.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>A parent who warned you about all the possible dangers in the workd may have made you feel like the world is a really scary place and that there is lots to worry about.
        </b>For example, eeing someone almost drown might make you super scared of water.
