<p>Panic attacks are sudden and intense rushes of fear marked by strong sensations
    (e.g. pounding heart, difficulty breathing, dizziness).
    Panic attacks are the body’s “alarm system" going off –
    even when there isn’t any real danger (like a false alarm).
    Panic attacks are actually pretty common. They can become a problem if you misinterpret
    the physical symptoms as being dangerous, rather than just being uncomfortable.
    They can also become a problem if you start avoiding situations or
    places where you’ve had a panic attack or might have one (e.g. being home alone, being in crowded places).
